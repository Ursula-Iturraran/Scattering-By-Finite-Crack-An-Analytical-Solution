# Scattering-By-Finite-Crack-An-Analytical-Solution
A Python and Fortran program to compute the analytic solution of the diffraction of SH waves by a finite plane crack. The classical Sommerfeld solution for a semi‐infinite straight reflecting screen is used as a building block. The Python program is a translation of the
original Fortran program here included. But the Fortran program only computes the solution in the time domain. The Python program includes
the computation in the time domain response via an FFT. The results generated by these programs are describe in the paper:

Sánchez-Sesma, F. J. and U. Iturrarán-Viveros. Scattering and diffraction of SH waves by a finite crack: an analytical solution. Geophys. J. Int.145(3), 749-758, 2001.
